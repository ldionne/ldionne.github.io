# Louis Dionne

I am a 23 years old math and programming enthusiast seeking excellence
in what I do. I work as a consultant, writing high quality C++ libraries
and applications to solve various problems.

My specialties are modern C++, generic library design and metaprogramming.
I am an active member of the [Boost][] community, and I authored the
[Boost.Hana][] library.

My more fancy interests revolve around functional programming, category
theory and their connection with C++ (meta)programming. Besides that, I
also enjoy hiking, dark beer and classical music.

I'm currently available for consulting; just [get in touch][mail].
