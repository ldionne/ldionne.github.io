# Louis Dionne

I am a math and programming enthusiast seeking excellence in what I do.
I work for [Apple][], where I maintain [libc++][], the C++ Standard Library
implementation under the LLVM umbrella project.

My specialties are modern C++, generic library design and metaprogramming.
I am a member of the C++ Standards Committee and of the [Boost][] community,
where I authored the [Boost.Hana][] library. I often speak at C++ conferences
like [CppCon][] and [C++Now][].

My fancier interests revolve around functional programming, category
theory and their connection with C++ (meta)programming. Besides that,
I also enjoy outdoor sports, dark beer and music.
