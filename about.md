# Louis Dionne

I am a 24 years old math and programming enthusiast seeking excellence
in what I do. I work for [A9.com][], writing high quality C++ libraries and
applications that power Amazon's search engine.

My specialties are modern C++, generic library design and metaprogramming.
I am an active member of the [Boost][] community, and I authored the
[Boost.Hana][] library.

My fancier interests revolve around functional programming, category
theory and their connection with C++ (meta)programming. Besides that,
I also enjoy hiking, dark beer and classical music.
